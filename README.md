# SCT_TrackCode_TaskNumber2
 I have been assigned to perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset â€” and the Titanic dataset is suggested. 

 ## ðŸ“Œ Key Insights:
- Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate.
- 1st class passengers were more likely to survive than 2nd and 3rd.
- Most passengers were in their 20s and 30s.
- Survival correlates positively with `sex` and `pclass`.

## âœ… Conclusion
I successfully:
- Cleaned and preprocessed the Titanic dataset
- Handled missing values smartly
- Visualized major patterns using EDA
- Identified relationships via correlation

This lays a great foundation for further modeling or prediction tasks.
